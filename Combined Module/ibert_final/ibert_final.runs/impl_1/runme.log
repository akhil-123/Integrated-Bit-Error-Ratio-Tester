WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net d1/channel_reset__0_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin d1/channel_reset__0/O, cell d1/channel_reset__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
